# grade.py
Tools for automated grading of python assignments.

This module differs from standard testing strategies in two major ways. First, it relies on a correct implementation of the module, making the creation of test cases very easy. Second, it is designed to identify graded quality of performance, rather than a binary PASS/FAIL judgement. It also provides Error Carried Forward functionality.

See `example/grade_foo.py` for example usage and a more detailed explanation.

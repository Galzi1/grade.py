# Example

In this directory, run `grade.py flc37/foo.py`. This will only work in this directory because `grade.py` needs to see the `grade_foo` module.

In `grade_foo/` you will find a correct implementation of the `foo` module, as well as a script to test student implementations, `tests.py`. This file explains in detail the construction of a testing script.
